# Confocal setup
The NV-analysis script was written during my PhD in Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin, Germany (2020-current). It is used for the data analysis of the obtained data on the setup named "confocal-setup", but also can be used for the analysis from other setups.

"Analysis.ipynb" contains scripts for the analisys of pulsed measurements, spectra, saturation cureves and lifetime. Use a "Table of Contents" jupyter notebook extension for navigation. Run "conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions" in the command line. After that, you can activate the individual extensions after launching Jupyter notebook in the Nbextensions Tab. More detailed instruction how to install extensions can be found here: https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html.

"qudi_analysis_functions.py" contains main constants and defined functions required for the data import, analysis and fitting.
